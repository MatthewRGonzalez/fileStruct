output: html_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# .Rmd master file

## Setup/Titles:

This first section of code initializes the Rmd document for knitting.

- Default output is html_document
- Author based on system user
- Title is created by fileStructure::createFullProject()

```{r dynamic titles, include = FALSE}
 author_param <-  ' matthew ' 
 date_param <- ' Mon Mar 29 15:31:40 2021 ' 
 title_param<- " First_Proj " 
```

---
title: `r title_param`
author: `r author_param`
date:  `r date_param`
---

## Idea
This file can be used to source different modules throughout the project.

Run the example below!

```{r source 1}
sys.source(paste(paste(getwd(),'/analysis/script1.R', sep = '')))
```
